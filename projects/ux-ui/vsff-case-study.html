				<!-- Intro -->
				<div class="proj-card-long-desc" style="background: #fff; margin-bottom: 30px;">
						<h2 class="proj-step-head">Introduction</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy">
							Since 2005, Vancouver Short Film Festival has been celebrating and promoting short films, music videos and animation videos with an aim to connect the emerging artists to the wider audience and established filmmakers.
							<br><br>
							As a student of UI/UX Strategy, I picked VSFF because I enjoy watching short films. As someone working in the creative field, I could relate to the process of filmmaking. When you are done editing a film or any other form of art, you have watched your film/art hundreds or even thousands of times. Artists, especially short filmmakers, start having second thoughts about their art. The level of confidence is usually low at this time.
							<br><br>
							Watching cinema is all about the experience. A film has to make you feel something. So should everything that is connected to films. Attending a film festival is a great experience but the website should also give a glimpse of that experience.
							<br><br>
							Beyond the experience, it should also be functional. The website should have an easy to understand the schedule of films being screened. It should have a clear and easy process for submitting the film for filmmakers. The website has to be mobile responsive as the audience or filmmakers won't always be on their computers while visiting the website.
							<br><br>
							This case study tries to analyze the current website of VSFF to identify any problems and inconsistencies that come in the way of users trying to accomplish their tasks. 
						</p>

				<!-- The Challenge -->
				<div class="proj-card-long-desc" style="background: #fff;">
					<h2 class="proj-step-head">The Challenge</h2>
					<p class="proj-step-copy">
						The whole identity of the festival on the website feels very vague and lacks confidence. When looking at the websites of VIFF and tiff, it's very clear what those festivals stand for.
						<br><br>
						The logo, typography, layout and overall design of VSFF give the impression that the festival screens very amateurish films. However, the films that are screened at the festival are of very high quality. They are just as good as the films that are screened at tiff and VIFF. The only difference is VSFF screens short films.
						<br><br>
						Most people think of short films as something less than feature films which are not true. The website's unprofessional design and the lack of some basic features combined with most people's perception will make it difficult for the festival to reach its potential audience.
					</p>

					</div>
					<div class="proj-card-exp" style="background: #fff">
						<h4 class="proj-step-subhead">Here are some inconsistencies that I encountered and wanted to fix:</h4>
						<p class="proj-step-copy">
						    - The process of submitting the film takes the filmmaker to another website that only allows the uploading of the film.
						    <br>
							- There is no easy to understand and navigate the schedule calendar that the audience can look at to know about the films being screened.
							<br>
							- There is a big banner on the landing page that doesn't look bad but also isn't exciting. The height of the banner makes it go beyond the whole screen of most computer screens. This, for a while, made me think that there isn't any more content after the banner.
							<br>
							- The website is not mobile responsive which makes the festival look less relevant in today's mobile-first digital age.
					</div>
				</div>

				<!-- The Process -->

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">The Process</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							With an aim to make the website look at what the festival really stands for, I started the process of redesigning the website. My objective was to make it more functional and easy to navigate and to represent a confident identity. The following is the process I went through.

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Third-Party Analysis</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							Some third-party tools like Nibbler and WebsiteGrader were used to analyze the website. The website fell short on mobile responsiveness according to both the tools.

					<!-- Pain Points -->
					<div class="proj-card-long-desc" style="background: #fff;">
						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Pain Points</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							After collecting all the data, I identified some pain points. These were the things that really made the user think if he wants to continue using the website or not.
							<br><br>
							1. The user wants to submit the film just by a link. He doesn't want to re-upload the whole film every time he submits his film to a festival.
							<br><br>
							2. There is no easy to understand schedule calendar for the films being screened.
							<br><br>
							3. The website is not responsive at all. This ruins the audience's experience, especially when they are attending the festival and have to check the schedule on their phones.
							<br><br>
							4. The schedule is a long list of film titles with descriptions. There's too much scrolling.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- Persona -->

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Persona</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							To put me in the shoes of the user, I developed a representation of a group of users. A film student seemed like the perfect choice since not only a film student undergoes the process of submitting a film but is an audience too. 
						</p>

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Scenario</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							This is what I imagined the user would do. Based on his personality and his goals, the following would be the way he gets to the website.

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Task Analysis</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							Based on the different user types and tasks, I made this task analysis chart to understand who will do what.
							<br><br>
							Since a film student does all the tasks that other users do, I focused on his journey.

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Journey Map</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							To understand the user's behaviour in-depth, I created a journey map that tries to get in the user's shoes every step of the way.
						</p>

					<!-- Journey Map: REVISION -->
					<div class="proj-card-long-desc" style="background: #fff;">
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							REVISION: After a peer review session, I found that the journey map is less holistic. I didn't take into consideration the user's state of mind before he got to the website and after he had finished his goal on the website. Also, I didn't touch on the user's pain points.
							<br><br>
							From the feedback that I got from other students and the instructor, I expanded the journey map a little more to understand the user's state of mind before and after using the website.

					<!-- Paper Prototyping -->

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Paper Prototyping</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							After collecting data from the website and understanding the user's behaviour, I picked up a pen and a paper to sketch a rough idea of how the website will behave and look.
							<br>
							So, I made a sketch of three of the website's pages i.e. home page, user dashboard page and the schedule calendar page. All these three pages were related to what the user wanted to do on the website.
						</p>

					<div class="proj-card-long-images">

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Wireframes</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							To refine the paper sketches, I made the wireframes of the three pages. The idea in my head was starting to make more sense with this. There were things that made sense on the paper but weren't working on the wireframes. So, I made some adjustments. 
						</p>

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Style Tile</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							To make the website look more serious and confident, I redesigned the logo and redefined the colours and typography of the website.

							I had the basic skeleton of the website and the design kit. I combined them together to make high fidelity prototypes of the pages that the user was going to use.
							<br>
							Since I didn't have enough time, I skipped the wireframes of some pages and based the design of new pages on the existing ones.

							I got some useful feedback from my classmates on the prototypes. Since I had spent a lot of time with the prototypes, it became a little personal and I was overlooking my mistakes in the design.

							The feedback that I got from other students pointed me to the things I was overlooking. Most seemed quite obvious from a user's perspective.

						<h2 class="proj-step-head" style="color:#000;">Conclusion</h2>
						<p class="proj-step-copy" style="color:#000;">
							I learned a lot from this project. I constantly had to change my perspective throughout the process. Looking at it from the festival owners' and the user‘s perspective to understand their objective, then seeing it from an analytical point of view to understand what is working and what isn't. And then trying to make sense of that data to give it a shape with which a user would want to interact with and feel accomplished. Getting feedback from other students and the instructor and incorporating it into the design was very helpful.
							<br><br>
							As a designer, it's easy to lose yourself in your design and UX is not about an individual. There are many stakeholders involved. Going through the whole process made the result a lot more meaningful and something that can make people's lives a little easier.
